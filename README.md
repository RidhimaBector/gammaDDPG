# gammaDDPG
This repository introduces gammaDDPG algorithm in the adversarial RL paradigm. Experiments show that by utilising dynamic discounting gammaDDPG becomes capable of learning training-time environment-poisoning attacks that can enforce victim agents to adopt extreme (non-optimal) target behaviours.
